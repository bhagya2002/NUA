                <strong>What is the CNSA?</strong> <br />
                The CNSA is the national voice of Canadian nursing students
                which represents nursing students on local, provincial, federal
                and international levels.
                <br />
                <br />
                The goals of the CNSA is to provide different resources to
                Canadian nursing students:
                <ol className="list-padding">
                  <li>They provide leadership opportunities</li>
                  <li>
                    They increase awareness of political issues, and ethical
                    issues to students
                  </li>
                  <li>They strengthen partnerships</li>
                </ol>

                The CNSA hosted the regional conference in Regina and
                Saskatchewan. Conference dates included October 26-27. This
                year’s theme was “Breaking Barriers: Exploring the Future
                Through Rural and Community Nursing."

                <strong>Notes from the Regional Conference:</strong>
                <br />
                At the conference, we voted on several topics and discussed
                important updates that may be coming to nursing students across
                Canada. This included discussing the termination of the NCLEX in
                Newfoundland, the resultant development of a new licensing exam
                for Canadians (not coming into effect for a few years at least),
                improvement of evaluations for our nursing practices, advocating
                for more undergraduate nurse employee (UNE) positions, bilingual
                programming work, and much more.
                <br />
                <br />
                I was able to attend sessions focused on cannabis use, the
                opioid crisis, stigmatization of the word "fat", structural
                violence in Nunvavut, proper patient care for queer individuals,
                and had the chance to attend a panel session with some of the
                first responders of the Humboldt Broncos bus tragedy.
                <br />
                <br />
                Lastly, I want to remind you all of some important resources
                that you receive as a member of a CNSA chapter school!

                    important to hear all of your opinions on any national

                    As the Associate Delegate, I have a very similar role to
                    that of the official delegate, in that I act as a resource
                    for nursing students in regards to the CNSA, and step in as
                    the official delegate (OD) when the OD is unavailable. You
                    can reach out to me if you have any concerns that you would
                    like me to address or advocate for related to your
                    undergraduate nursing education, or for Canadian nursing
                    students as a whole. I actively promote the CNSA at the
                    University of Alberta, and try to share with you the
                    interesting and useful resources that the CNSA has to offer
                    including discounts, scholarships, and opportunities. At
                    regional and national conferences, I am responsible to
                    advocate and/or vote on your behalf, which is why I seek out
                    your feedback prior to attending these conferences (Ex.
                    concerns, addressing controversial issues, the NCLEX, etc.).
                    Basically, the OD and I are your voices at a national level,
                    and I am happy to provide information and guidance whenever
                    possible. I am also responsible for planning and executing
                    the National Nursing Students' Week (NNSW) with the OD,
                    which occurs annually in November. Please feel free to
                    contact me at alberta@cnsa.ca or jhudson@ualberta.ca if you
                    have any questions about the CNSA/NNSW, how you can get
                    involved at the chapter level, or if you have a topic or
                    concern that you would like me to address with the CNSA.
                    Remember: You are important, and deserve the best nursing
                    school experience possible - speak up and get involved to
                    see change happen!
